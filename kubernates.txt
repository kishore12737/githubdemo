How to set up a Kubernetes cluster on a local machine using minikube?
Kubernetes – Physical Servers vs Virtual Machines vs Containers

cluster: collection of multiple system as cluster.
collection of nodes.

1.master node:
-brain of the infastruture.
-master node conected with worker node both are communicated.
-controllering operations are doing worker node.
-master renamed called as control clane

2.worker node:
actual microservers are handling systems.
containers,deployements are workr node handled.

master server: in cloud vm or physical server,Ec2 instance
    
linux machine having in master server.

--components.

1. Api server
2. Controller manager
3. schduler
4. etcd

its  a brain of the server, then it connected nodes

1. Api server:

API server is a component of the kubernates control plane that expose kubernates API.
API server is the front end for the kubernates control plane. 

2.schduler:
 control plane component that watches for newly created pods with no assigned node and select a node for 
them  to run on.

3.Controller manager: 
control plane  components that runs controller processes.

4.etcd:
Consitent and highly-available key value store used as kubernates backing store for all cluster data.

all data stored in the etcd

workload components:

pods:
 
kubernates is called as pod(container).

pod is a collection one or more contianers then it is called as pod.
